## <b>Assignment</b>
Write a program that asks the user for a number, and then says whether that number is a prime number or not.

### What are prime numbers?
A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by 1 and itself. The lowest (and only <i>even</i>) prime number is 2. The first 10 prime numbers are:
    2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29

<i>(PS: the official definition is a bit more specific, making 1 not a prime number)</i>

## Example 1
### Input
```console?lang=python
5
```

### Output
```console?lang=python
5 is prime
```

## Example 2
### Input
```console?lang=python
21
```

### Output
```console?lang=python
21 is not prime
```
<i>(because 21 is also divisible by 3 and 7)</i>

## Example 3
### Input
```console?lang=python
17
```

### Output
```console?lang=python
17 is prime
```

## Example 4
### Input
```console?lang=python
55
```

### Output
```console?lang=python
55 is not prime
```
<i>(because 55 is also divisible by 5 and 11)</i>
