# <b>Assignment</b>

Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer, and then prints the complete Collatz sequence (also called the <code>3n + 1</code> sequence), starting from that number and ending at 1.

<details markdown="1"><summary>What is the Collatz sequence?</summary>  
The Collatz sequence is a sequence of numbers where each next number is calculated according to these two rules:  

1. **Is the number even?** Divide it by 2.
2. **Is the number odd?** Multiply it by 3 and add 1.

Repeat these steps over and over.

The Collatz Conjecture states that you will always eventually reach the number 1, no matter which positive integer you start with.

Below are some examples:

<table class="table" style="width:50%">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Starting number</th>
      <th>Collatz sequence</th>
      <th>Why?</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1</td>
      <td>
        <code>6 / 2 = 3</code><br>
        <code>3 × 3 + 1 = 10</code><br>
        <code>10 / 2 = 5</code><br>
        ...
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1</td>
      <td>
        <code>11 × 3 + 1 = 34</code><br>
        <code>34 / 2 = 17</code><br>
        ...
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>19</td>
      <td>19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, ... , 2, 1</td>
      <td>
        <code>19 × 3 + 1 = 58</code><br>
        <code>58 / 2 = 29</code><br>
        ...
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<i>(PS: While this hypothesis has not been mathematically proven, no one has yet found a positive integer that does not end at 1.)</i>
