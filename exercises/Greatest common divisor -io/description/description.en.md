# <b>Assignment</b>
Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and thand displays their greatest commor divisor.

<details markdown="1"><summary>What is a greatest common divisor?</summary>
The greatest common divisor for two integers is the greatest positive integer by which both integers can be divided without leaving a rest. The greatest common divisor of the integers `8` and `12` is, for example, `4`, because:
- The divisors of `8` are `1`, `2`, `4`, and `8`
- The divisors of `12` are `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`, and `12`
- So the divisors they have in common are `1`, `2`, and `4`
- The greatest of these is `4`.
